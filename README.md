# Simclr-Reproducation

This repository contains a PyTorch reproduction of the [Simclr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) based on the [https://github.com/Spijkervet/SimCLR](https://github.com/Spijkervet/SimCLR).

In our reproduction, we rerun the SimCLR linear evaluation and finetune on CIFAR10 and visualize the embedding space.

Different from the original paper, we also visualize the embedding space on RPLAN dataset to show the model's performance.

The checkpoints come from the [Official Implementation](https://https://github.com/google-research/simclr). 

The source code for the implementation is available in src directory.

The blog of reproducing in shown in the [GitHub Page](https://carloschu-c.github.io/Simclr-Reproducation/).
